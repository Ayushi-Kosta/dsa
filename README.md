<hr><h4>Q1. Positioning of Mirror</h4>

During the Induction program at JEC, Chef began liking a girl and wants to look at her. They are sitting in an Auditorium and you are friends with Chef. You have to place a mirror (point size) on the front wall of the hall so that Chef can have a glimpse of her. Consider the front wall as the x-axis. You are given the coordinates of the position of Chef and his Crush (x1,y1), (x2,y2) respectively. Find the position where the mirror should be placed.<br>
**Input:**<br>
The first line contains the number of test cases T.<br>
The next T lines will have two lines:<br>
Line one contains the coordinates of Chef.<br>
Line two contains the coordinates of Chef’s crush.<br>
**Output:**<br>
T lines each giving the correct x-coordinate of the mirror up to two decimal places.<br>
Sample input:<br>
1<br>
1 1<br>
4 4<br>
Sample output:<br>
1.60<br>
**Constraints:**<br>
-10<sup>9</sup> <= x1,x2 <= 10<sup>9</sup><br>
0 < y1, y1 <= 10<sup>9</sup><br>

<hr><h4>Q2. Maximum Subarray</h4>
Given an integer array nums , find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.<br>
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.<br>

**Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.<br>
**Constraints :**<br>
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup><br>
-10 <sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>

<hr><h4>Q3. Trapping Rainwater</h4>
Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season.<br>

**Input:** arr[] = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]<br>
**Output:** 6<br>
![Rain Water Trapping](https://i.imgur.com/7UFvD5D.png)<br>
Explanation:<br>
The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.<br>
**Constraints :**<br>
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup><br>
-10 <sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>

<hr><h4>Q4. Intersection of Two Linked Lists</h4>
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.<br>

**Input:** LinkedList1 = 3->6->9->common<br>
LinkedList2 = 10->common<br>
Common = 15->30->NULL<br>
**Output:** 15<br>
![Intersection of two linked lists](https://i.imgur.com/SNliHgD.jpg)<br>
Explanation: <br>
Following two linked lists begin to intersect at node 15.<br>
**Constraints :**<br>
1 ≤ N + M ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup><br>
-1000 ≤ value ≤ 1000<br>

<hr><h4>Q5. Zig-Zag traversal of binary tree</h4>
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).<br>

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br>
**Output:** [ [3], [20,9], [15,7] ]<br>

Explanation: <br>
Following two linked lists begin to intersect at node 15.<br>
**Constraints :**<br>
1 ≤ N + M ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup><br>
-1000 ≤ value ≤ 1000<br>
