<hr><h4>Q1. Positioning of Mirror</h4>

During the Induction program at JEC, Chef began liking a girl and wants to look at her. They are sitting in an Auditorium and you are friends with Chef. You have to place a mirror (point size) on the front wall of the hall so that Chef can have a glimpse of her. Consider the front wall as the x-axis. You are given the coordinates of the position of Chef and his Crush (x1,y1), (x2,y2) respectively. Find the position where the mirror should be placed.
**Input:**
The first line contains the number of test cases T.
The next T lines will have two lines:
Line one contains the coordinates of Chef.
Line two contains the coordinates of Chef’s crush.
**Output:**
T lines each giving the correct x-coordinate of the mirror up to two decimal places.
Sample input:
1
1 1
4 4
Sample output:
1.60
**Constraints:**
-10<sup>9</sup> <= x1,x2 <= 10<sup>9</sup>
0 < y1, y1 <= 10<sup>9</sup>

<hr><h4>Q2. Maximum Subarray</h4>
Given an integer array nums , find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.<br>
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
**Output:** 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
**Constraints :**
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
-10 <sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

<hr><h4>Q3. Trapping Rainwater</h4>
Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

**Input:** arr[] = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
**Output:** 6
Explanation:
![Rain Water Trapping](https://i.imgur.com/7UFvD5D.png)
The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
**Constraints :**
1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
-10 <sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

<hr><h4>Q4. Intersection of Two Linked Lists</h4>
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

**Input:** LinkedList1 = 3->6->9->common
LinkedList2 = 10->common
Common = 15->30->NULL
**Output:** 15
Explanation: ![Intersection of two linked lists](https://i.imgur.com/SNliHgD.jpg)
Following two linked lists begin to intersect at node 15.
**Constraints :**
1 ≤ N + M ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup>
-1000 ≤ value ≤ 1000

<hr><h4>Q5. Zig-Zag traversal of binary tree</h4>
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** [ [3], [20,9], [15,7] ]
Explanation: ![Zigzag traversal of binary tree](https://i.imgur.com/g5PA9lQ.jpg)
Following two linked lists begin to intersect at node 15.
**Constraints :**
1 ≤ N + M ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup>
-1000 ≤ value ≤ 1000
